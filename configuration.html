<h1>Configuration</h1>
<p>The configuration files provide the configuration that you need to change per app. Ideally they define the minimal amount possible, but with the way clouds are it can be impossible to use pure naming conventions. I like providing the bare minimum and then creating defaults for the user if they do not provide a specific value. This way we get the benefits of automatic values with the power to override where needed. Don&#39;t overthink this. Being able to add new config vaules and not needing to go define them in 1000 files is one of the things this method gives us.</p>
<p>It is ok to use JSON or YAML depending on the preferences of the team. The reference implementation uses JSON extended to allow other files to be included and glued together to make a final config and comments are ok and will be ignored. Use something standard here with a library that easily loads the config into your target language. Supporting an include can reduce duplication, but you could achieve this with a split configuration as well.</p>
