<h1>Creating Controllers</h1>
<p>Now that we have a standard way to talk to other applications we need to write the code that does the actual work. This takes the form of a controller class with a Run function on it. That Run function can optionally take the top level configuration class instance. The controllers separate the per app configuration from the classes that are injected to do work. This way they can be reused to do more work later. Ideally they will have no state at all to make it possible to use them in parallel, but this isn&#39;t always possible. There aren&#39;t too many rules for controllers. If you keep them small and composable you will be able to test them more easily in small pieces, but you can still create other controllers that do several pieces of work. The reference implementation can do a full provision and deployment using a single command on a set of files. This is built out of the other smaller controllers.</p>
<p>Controllers should only trigger other work, they do not return any values and will throw exceptions when something goes wrong. It is expected that controllers can include other controllers to create commands that do multiple tasks at once. If you need to do work that returns a value consider creating a Service.</p>
